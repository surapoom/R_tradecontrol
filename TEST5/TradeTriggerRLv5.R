# PURPOSE: Analyse trade results in Terminal 1 and Trigger or Stop Trades in Terminal 3
# DETAILS: Trades are analysed and RL model is created for each single Expert Advisor
#        : Q states function is calculated, whenever Action 'ON' is > than 'OFF' trade trigger will be active   
#        : Results are written to the file of the MT4 Trading Terminal
# NOTE:    TEST4
#          : Next action is defined as a random sequence ON/OFF/ON/OFF for the first 10 trades
#          : specific model is trained
#          : for the subsequent trades next action is generated using obtained model
#          : model is retrained using data from the following trades...
#          : reinforcement learning model objects are not saved
# NOTE:    TEST5
#          : Reinforcement Learning Models are created for each specific system considering 6 Market Types
#          : RL would learn to select the best Market Types to switch ON/OFF Trading Systems

# ----------- Applied Logic -----------------
# -- Read trading results from Terminal 1
# -- Read market type logs from Terminal 1
# -- Rearrange data for RL
# -- Perform Reinforcement Learning or Update Model with New Data
# -- Start/Stop trades in Terminal 3 based on New Policy
# -- Start/Stop trades on Terminals at MacroEconomic news releases (covered in Course #5)
